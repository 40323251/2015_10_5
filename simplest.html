    <p>第四週作業心得--這次使用的是SolveSpace繪圖軟體，使用上感覺比proe好用，應該是一個很不錯的繪圖軟體，不過因為英文介面會看不懂，所以可能需要加強一下英文能力。</p>

    <h2>第5周作業心得</h2>
    <p>Creo_Parametric 2.0這個軟體其實就是pro e 只是因為在今年被Creo公司合併了才改名，在這套軟體當中，可以發現跟其他繪圖軟體相似許多的地方，基本上操作模式大同小異，不過令我感到最大的方便之處在於，組合圖中的零件與零件相配合時，軟體內建有自動功能，所以並不需要特別點選使用什麼約束，而是軟體自動幫我判定，這一大優點讓我覺得pro e是個滿有效率的軟體。

War and Peace

        by Leo Tolstoy/Tolstoi
        
        BOOK ONE: 1805
"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if
you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more to
do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave',
as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you--sit
down and tell me all the news."

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna
Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With
these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and
importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had
had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe;
grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

Neither this node nor any descendant node will appear in the output file.
TL;DR

...la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,* ...
*The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere
recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves
sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients.

..  organizer node (a node whose name does not appear in the output document),
..  and that rst comments appear as html comments (try 'View Source' on

In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an
unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel; in
the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does
not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious.

    <h2>成績自評</h2>
    <p>成績自評分數的量化依據?</p>
    <p>第3周並沒有在限定時間內完成作業，而是後來才補交作業的，所以我給自己60分 。
    但第4周與第5周的功課我都很用心在完成，並且也在其中獲得許多知識，更在其中發現滿喜歡使用leo的，因為真的非常方便，用來排版網頁也很容易，滿好上手的。
    並且在作業中也繳交了截圖與影片，以證明我的成績量化依據，也方便老師用來評分。所以想把分數提高到70分。
